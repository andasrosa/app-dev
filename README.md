My favorite would be the *The Titan's Curse* because it introduced one of my favorite character which is Nico the son of Hades. My all time favovite would still be Perseus Jackson of course the son of Poseidon. My favorite Greek God would be the Last Olympian, Hestia, she is the goddess of home and hearth. If you would like to start your journey in reading this book is a great place to start. **WELCOME TO CAMP BLOOD HILL!**
